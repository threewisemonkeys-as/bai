- The game is turn-based, with each keypress mapped to an action; for example, waiting a turn uses MiscDirection.WAIT: 46 and searching uses Command.SEARCH: 115, implying time advances per command.

- Movement happens on a grid with 8-directional control. Cardinal moves use CompassDirection.N: 107, E: 108, S: 106, W: 104, and diagonals use NE: 117, SE: 110, SW: 98, NW: 121.

- There are run/long-move variants that continue in a direction until interrupted, via CompassDirectionLonger.N: 75, E: 76, S: 74, W: 72, NE: 85, SE: 78, SW: 66, NW: 89.

- Item pickup/drop and auto-pickup are explicit mechanics: Command.PICKUP: 44, Command.DROP: 100, Command.DROPTYPE: 68, and Command.AUTOPICKUP: 64 to toggle behavior.

- Environmental writing is a mechanic: Command.ENGRAVE: 69 (write on the ground), which often interacts with monsters/effects; the presence of Command.WIPE: 247 suggests altering or removing engravings.

- Religion/altar mechanics are present: Command.PRAY: 240 (pray for aid/penance) and Command.OFFER: 239 (sacrifice/offer on altars), implying alignment and deity reactions.

- There are sensory/knowledge menus: Command.ATTRIBUTES: 24 (show stats/roles), Command.KNOWN: 92 and Command.KNOWNCLASS: 96 (known item discoveries), Command.HISTORY: 86 (message history), Command.CONDUCT: 195 (voluntary challenges), showing metagame tracking.

- Door/lock/trap interactions are advanced: Command.UNTRAP: 245, Command.FORCE: 230, Command.OPEN: 111, Command.CLOSE: 99, and Command.SEARCH: 115 implying hidden doors/traps and multiple ways to bypass obstacles.

- Mobility has special actions: Command.JUMP: 234 (jump over/onto tiles), Command.TELEPORT: 20 (instant relocation), and vertical MiscDirection.UP: 60 / DOWN: 62, suggesting terrain and hazards where special movement matters.

- The UI supports extended commands via Command.EXTCMD: 35 (the “#” menu) and a listing via Command.EXTLIST: 191, implying many rarely used or context-specific actions beyond single keys.

- The presence of Command.APPLY: 97 (use tools), Command.TIP: 212, Command.LOOT: 236, and Command.FORCE: 230 suggests a highly interactive environment where item-context interactions produce varied outcomes.

- Combat and exploration likely share a single action-per-turn budget; even informational commands like Command.LOOK: 58 probably do not consume turns, while actions like Command.SEARCH: 115 and movement commands (e.g., CompassDirection.W: 104) do consume turns.

- The combination of Command.TRAVEL: 95, CompassDirectionLonger.* (75/76/74/72/85/78/66/89), and Command.RUSH: 103/Command.RUSH2: 71 implies “run until something interesting” automation that stops on threats, items, or intersections, supporting large, complex maps.

- Mounts and pets likely exist: Command.RIDE: 210 (mount/dismount) and Command.CHAT: 227 (talk to peaceful/pet monsters) indicate companion systems with special commands.

- There is likely permadeath/save-on-exit behavior typical of roguelikes, hinted by Command.SAVE: 83 and Command.QUIT: 241 being explicit, and the presence of Command.VERSION: 246/Command.VERSIONSHORT: 118 suggests a traditional lineage where version differences matter.
